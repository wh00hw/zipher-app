# Zipher

> Making Zcash accessible. For everyone.

Zipher is a privacy-first Zcash wallet — for humans and AI agents. One Rust engine, two interfaces: a mobile app for everyday use and a headless CLI for autonomous agents.

Built by [Atmosphere Labs](https://atmospherelabs.dev).

## Zipher Mobile

Fast, shielded Zcash wallet built for simplicity and privacy. Forked from [YWallet](https://github.com/hhanh00/zwallet) by Hanh Huynh Huu — redesigned with a modern UI, secure architecture, and developer-friendly features.

- **Shielded by Default** — sends from shielded pool only, with one-tap shielding for transparent funds
- **Cross-Chain Swaps** — swap ZEC to BTC, ETH, SOL and more via NEAR Intents
- **Secure Seed Storage** — seeds in iOS Keychain / Android Keystore, keys derived in RAM, wiped on close
- **Multi-Wallet** — manage multiple wallets from a single app, with optional watch-only import
- **Testnet Mode** — full testnet with integrated faucet, built for developers
- **Memo Inbox** — receive and read encrypted on-chain memos
- **Privacy Health Bar** — see your shielded vs transparent balance at a glance
- **ZIP-321 Payments** — scan payment URIs, multi-output split payments
- **Contact Book, QR Scanner, Fiat Conversion** — the full toolkit

**Requirements:** iOS 16.4+ / Android 7.0+

## zipher-cli

Headless, local-first Zcash light wallet for AI agents. No full node. No cloud custody. Keys never leave the machine.

```
zipher-cli wallet create
zipher-cli sync start
zipher-cli send propose --to <ADDRESS> --amount 100000
ZIPHER_SEED="..." zipher-cli send confirm
```

- **Light client** — syncs in minutes, runs on a $5 VPS or Raspberry Pi
- **Two-step send** — propose (no seed) then confirm (seed required), safe for agent workflows
- **Hardware wallet signing** — PCZT flow for Orchard + transparent inputs via Ledger / any HWP v2/v3 device, with on-device ZIP-244 sighash and transparent-digest verification (no seed on host)
- **Spending policy** — per-tx limits, daily caps, allowlist, rate limiting
- **Audit log** — every spend recorded with timestamps and context IDs
- **Daemon mode** — background sync with IPC, kill switch to zeroize seed in memory
- **MCP server** — 8 tools for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible client
- **OpenClaw skill** — guarded send flow with preflight checks

## Architecture

```

The engine crate is the single source of truth for wallet logic. Every consumer — mobile app, CLI, MCP server — uses the same Rust code for key derivation, proof generation, and transaction construction.

## Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) — mobile UI (iOS & Android)
- [librustzcash](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash) — Zcash protocol libraries and light client SDK
- [zcash-hw-wallet-sdk](https://github.com/wh00hw/zcash-hw-wallet-sdk) + [libzcash-orchard-c](https://github.com/wh00hw/libzcash-orchard-c) — PCZT-based hardware wallet signing (Orchard + transparent, on-device ZIP-244 verification)
- [rmcp](https://github.com/anthropics/rmcp) — Model Context Protocol server SDK
- [NEAR Intents](https://near.org/intents) — cross-chain swap infrastructure

## Privacy

- No data collection, no analytics, no tracking
- All data recoverable from seed phrase
- Customizable `lightwalletd` server URL
- Shielded pool used by default for all operations

Default servers powered by [CipherScan](https://cipherscan.app) infrastructure.
